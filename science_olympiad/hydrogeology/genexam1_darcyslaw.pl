TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
An aquifer has a cross sectional horizontal width of 265 m, and a vertical thickness below the water table of 42.0 m. The water table is 36.0 m below the ground surface. Each day, 3.34 million L of water is discharged through the cross sectional area. The aquifer rock has an effective porosity of 27.1%. Use Darcyâ€™s law to find the a) Darcy speed, and b) actual speed of water as it passes through the aquifer.
